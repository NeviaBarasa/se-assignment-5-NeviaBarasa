2. Watch Expressions:
   - Add Watch Expressions: In the Run and Debug view, expand the "Watch" section and click the `+` icon to add expressions you want to monitor.

3. Call Stack:
   - View Call Stack: The Call Stack section shows the stack trace of the running program. You can navigate through the call stack to inspect different frames.

4. Variables:
   - Inspect Variables: The Variables section displays local variables, arguments, and their values. You can expand objects to inspect their properties.

5. Debug Console:
   - Evaluate Expressions: Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions and execute commands in the context of the paused program.
   - View Output: It also displays program output and debugging messages.

6. Step Controls:
   - Step Over (`F10`): Execute the next line of code but do not step into functions.
   - Step Into (`F11`): Step into functions to debug inside them.
   - Step Out (`Shift + F11`): Step out of the current function and return to the calling code.
   - Continue (`F5`): Resume program execution until the next breakpoint is hit.

7. Exception Handling:
   - Break on Exceptions: Configure breakpoints to pause execution when exceptions are thrown. Modify this in `launch.json` with `"stopOnEntry": true`.

8. Integrated Terminal:
   - Terminal Usage: Use the integrated terminal for running commands or additional scripts during the debugging process without leaving the editor.


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

 Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control

VS Code provides built-in support for Git, making it easy to manage version control within the editor. Here’s a step-by-step guide to integrating Git, initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

 Step-by-Step Process

 1. Initial Setup

1. Install Git:
   - Ensure Git is installed on your system. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - Verify installation by running `git --version` in your terminal.

2. Open VS Code:
   - Open VS Code and the project folder you want to manage with Git.

 2. Initializing a Repository

1. Open Source Control View:
   - Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Alternatively, you can open it using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + G`.

2. Initialize Repository:
   - Click the `Initialize Repository` button in the Source Control view.
   - This creates a `.git` folder in your project directory, setting up the Git repository.

 3. Making Commits

1. Staging Changes:
   - Make changes to your files.
   - In the Source Control view, you will see a list of changed files under "Changes."
   - Hover over a file and click the `+` icon (Stage Changes) to stage the file.
   - You can stage all changes by clicking the `+` icon next to "Changes."

2. Writing a Commit Message:
   - After staging the changes, enter a commit message in the text box above the "Changes" list.

3. Committing Changes:
   - Click the checkmark icon (Commit) above the commit message box.
   - Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Enter`.

 4. Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. Connecting to a Remote Repository:
   - If you don’t have a remote repository yet, create one on GitHub:
     - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
     - Click the `New repository` button and follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - Copy the repository URL from GitHub.

2. Adding the Remote Repository:
   - Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ` (backtick)).
   - Add the remote repository using the following command:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin <repository_url>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

3. Pushing Changes:
   - Push your changes to GitHub by clicking the `...` menu in the Source Control view and selecting `Push` (or use the terminal):
     ```sh
     git push -u origin master
     ```
   - If it’s your first push, you may need to set the upstream branch:
     ```sh
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - Replace `main` with `master` or your default branch name as necessary.

 Summary of Key Features in VS Code's Git Integration

1. Source Control View:
   - Central hub for all Git-related activities, including viewing changes, staging, committing, and synchronizing.

2. Git Commands:
   - Common Git commands like pull, push, fetch, and merge are accessible from the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) by typing "Git."

3. Branch Management:
   - Create, switch, and delete branches directly from the Source Control view or Command Palette.

4. GitLens Extension:
   - Enhances VS Code’s Git capabilities with features like blame, commit search, and repository insights.

5. Diff Viewer:
   - View differences between file versions with a built-in diff viewer by clicking on changed files in the Source Control view.

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Perform advanced Git operations directly in the integrated terminal within VS Code.
